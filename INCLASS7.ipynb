            "________________Artificial\n",
            "1. \"Artificiality (the state of being artificial or anthropogenic) is the state of being the product of intentional human manufacture, rather than occurring naturally through processes not involving or requiring human activity.\" - The term \"anthropogenic\" specifically refers to effects or processes that are derived from human activities, not necessarily artificiality.\n",
            "2. \"The philosopher Aristotle wrote in his Rhetoric: Naturalness is persuasive, artificiality is the contrary; for our hearers are prejudiced and think we have some design against them, as if we were mixing their wines for them.\" - Without specific citation or direct quote, it's uncertain whether these are Aristotle's actual words or interpretation of his thoughts.\n",
            "3. \"Political scientist and artificial intelligence expert Herbert A. Simon observes that \"some artificial things are imitations of things in nature...\" - Without exact reference, it's not possible to confirm this statement was made by Herbert A. Simon.\n",
            "4. \"Some philosophers have gone further and asserted that, in a deterministic world, \"everything is natural and nothing is artificial\" - The statement is given without attributions for identification of these philosophers.\n",
            "5. \"The artificial environment tends to have more physical regularity both spatially and over time, with natural environments tending to have both irregular structures and structures that change over time.\" - This assertion may not be true for all cases. Artificial environments can also have irregular elements and change over time, and natural environments can also show regular structures.\n",
            "6. \"However, on close observation it is possible to discern some mathematical structures and patterns in natural environments, which can then be replicated to create an artificial environment with a more natural appearance.\" - It's not always possible to replicate natural structures and patterns.\n",
            "________________Intelligence\n",
            "\"The term [intelligence] rose to prominence during the early 1900s.\" - The study of human intelligence has a long history that predates the 1900s.\n",
            "\"Intelligence is most often studied in humans but has also been observed in both non-human animals and plants despite controversy as to whether some of these forms of life exhibit intelligence.\" - It is controversial whether plants can exhibit intelligence in the same way humans or animals do.\n",
            "\"Hereditary intelligence is the theory that intelligence is fixed upon birth and does not grow.\" - This is a simplification. Hereditary factors play a role in intelligence, but it's not generally believed that they completely fix intelligence at birth without any room for growth. \n",
            "\"Emotional intelligence is thought to be the ability to convey emotion to others in an understandable way as well as to read the emotions of others accurately.\" - While this is part of emotional intelligence, it does not fully cover all aspects of emotional intelligence, such as managing and using emotions. \n",
            "\"Moral intelligence is the capacity to understand right from wrong and to behave based on the value that is believed to be right. It is considered a distinct form of intelligence, independent to both emotional and cognitive intelligence.\" - The existence of \"moral intelligence\" as a distinct form of intelligence is not universally accepted in the field of psychology.\n",
            "\"Concepts of \"book smarts\" and \"street smart\" are contrasting views based on the premise that some people have knowledge gained through academic study, but may lack the experience to sensibly apply that knowledge, while others have knowledge gained through practical experience, but may lack accurate information usually gained through study by which to effectively apply that knowledge.\" - There is controversy whether \"book smarts\" and \"street smarts\" can be truly separated or whether they are parts of a more complex spectrum of intelligence.\n",
            "________________UCLA\n",
            "1. \"Its academic roots were established in 1881 as a normal school then known as the southern branch of the California State Normal School which later evolved into San José State University.\"\n",
            "2. \"making it the second-oldest of the ten-campus University of California system after the University of California, Berkeley.\"\n",
            "3. \"UCLA offers 337 undergraduate and graduate degree programs in a range of disciplines, enrolling about 31,600 undergraduate and 14,300 graduate and professional students annually.\"\n",
            "4. \"It received 174,914 undergraduate applications for Fall 2022, including transfers, making it the most applied-to university in the United States.\"\n",
            "5. \"Six of the schools offer undergraduate degree programs: Arts and Architecture, Engineering and Applied Science, Music, Nursing, Public Affairs, and Theater, Film and Television.\"\n",
            "6. \"Three others are graduate-level professional health science schools: Medicine, Dentistry, and Public Health.\"\n",
            "7. \"They have won 121 NCAA team championships, second only to Stanford University's 128 team titles.\"\n",
            "8. \"410 Bruins have made Olympic teams, winning 270 Olympic medals: 136 gold, 71 silver and 63 bronze.\"\n",
            "9. \"UCLA has been represented in every Olympics since the university's founding (except in 1924) and has had a gold medalist in every Olympics in which the U.S. has participated since 1932.\"\n",
            "10. \"As of October 2021, 27 Nobel laureates, five Turing Award winners, two Chief Scientists of the U.S. Air Force and one Fields Medalist have been affiliated with it as faculty, researchers and alumni.\"\n",
            "11. \"As of August 2021, 55 associated faculty members have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, 29 to the National Academy of Engineering, 41 to the National Academy of Medicine and 156 to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\"\n",
            "12. \"On June 1, 2016, two men were killed in a murder-suicide at an engineering building in the university.\"\n",
            "13. \"In February 2022, Matthew Harris, a former lecturer and postdoctoral fellow at UCLA, was arrested after allegedly making numerous threats of violence against students and faculty members of UCLA's Philosophy Department.\"\n",
            "14. \"In 2018, a student-led community coalition known as \"Westwood Forward\" successfully led an effort to break UCLA and Westwood Village away from the existing Westwood Neighborhood Council and form a new North Westwood Neighborhood Council, with over 2,000 out of 3,521 stakeholders voting in favor of the split.\"\n",
            "15. \"In 2022, UCLA signed an agreement to partner with the Tongva for the caretaking and landscaping of various areas of the campus.\"\n",
            "16. \"In 2014, a graduate student adviser and professor in the history department, Gabriel Piterberg, was accused of sexually assaulting two students.\"\n"
